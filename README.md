# Java_Assignment5_Part1

Implement the generic Shapes class as an interface s so that we can implement concrete classes like circle, triangle, rectangle class from it.

Write an abstract class Shape:

Protected Data members: dim1, dim2, dim3, numSides
Constructor: initialize numSides and dimensions, zero and parameterized constructors
Concrete method: getmethod() for numSides
Abstract methods: getArea(), getPerimeter()
Write a concrete subclass Rectangle

Protected Data members: dim1, dim2,
Write a concrete subclass Triangle

Protected Data members: dim1, dim2,
Write a concrete subclass Circle

Protected Data members: dim1, dim2,
In another class, write a main method to define a Rectangle and a Triangle and Circle using concepts of Dynamic method Dispatch
